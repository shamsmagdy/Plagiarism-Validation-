Problem Definition
In our project, we leverage MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity), a system designed to detect similarities in software. Our goal is to enhance the review process by making it more efficient and manageable for evaluators. MOSS helps us identify matching pairs that exhibit similarities. However, among these pairs, some matches are deemed insignificant, and cyclical patterns can emerge—for instance, if file 1 is similar to file 2, file 2 to file 3, and file 3 back to file 1, creating a cycle. The aim of our project is to address these issues by filtering out such cycles and prioritizing the matching pairs that show the highest degree of similarity, while disregarding the lower and less consequential pairs that do not significantly impact the analysis.
To achieve this, we propose an optimized approach that not only identifies all connected components within the similarity graph generated by MOSS but also refines these components by removing cycles. This refinement process involves constructing a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) for each component, focusing on the edges with the highest similarity scores to eliminate redundancy. By doing so, we can ensure that the evaluators are presented with the most pertinent and impactful matches, streamlining the review process, and enhancing the overall efficiency of similarity detection.
This project is expected to significantly reduce the workload on evaluators by automating the process of sifting through numerous matches to identify the ones that truly matter. Through intelligent filtering and prioritization, we can focus on the similarities that warrant further investigation, thereby making the best use of the evaluators' time and resources.
General Idea
The general idea of our project revolves around the sophisticated analysis of software similarity by employing a two-step optimization process within the framework provided by MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity). Initially, our approach seeks to meticulously identify all connected components within the similarity graph generated by MOSS. A connected component is a subset of files or software snippets where each pair within the subset shares a direct or indirect similarity, forming a cohesive cluster within the larger network of comparisons.
Once these connected components are identified, the next pivotal step involves the exclusion of cyclical redundancy within each component. These cycles can obscure the clarity of results and may lead to inefficiencies in the evaluation process.
To address this challenge, it’s required to construct a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) for each connected component. The MST is a concept borrowed from graph theory, which in our context, is applied to prune the similarity graph by retaining only the most significant similarity connections, or "edges," within each component. The goal here is to maximize the sum of the similarity scores in the tree, ensuring that the retained similarities are those with the highest values, hence the term "Maximum Spanning Tree." This process effectively eliminates less significant and redundant similarities, streamlining the component to its most essential connections without compromising the integrity of the similarity analysis.
